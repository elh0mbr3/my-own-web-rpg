- Added grid borders to dungeon tiles for improved visual clarity.
- Fixed bonus door key logic so only one key is allowed and the bonus door opens correctly.
- Refactored website layout by separating screens into distinct divs (merchant screen on the left, game canvas in the centre, event log on the right, and HUD at the bottom).
- Corrected the "Return" button functionality on the merchant screen to properly restore the game container and resume gameplay.
- Updated the merchant interface to display the player's inventory for selling items.
- Added a vertical scrollbar to the event log container to prevent layout conflicts with the HUD.
